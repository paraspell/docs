# List of interesting ParaSpell✨ repositories

## [Monorepo](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-tools/tree/main) packages and applications 🧰

### XCM-SDK 🪄
[SDK link](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-tools/tree/main/packages/sdk) |  
The SDK unifies various pallets, including `XCM`, and `Asset pallet`, in a cohesive manner. It supports all XCM-compatible Parachains within the Kusama and the Polkadot ecosystems and is designed for ease of implementation, abstracting much of the complex logic and requiring only a few simple, user-friendly inputs.

### XCM-API (LightSpell⚡️)
[API link](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-tools/tree/main/apps/xcm-api) |  
The XCM API serves as an enhancement for `XCM` and `Asset pallet`, designed to simplify the development process. By integrating the `XCM SDK` and `XCM Router`, it enables dApp developers to incorporate XCM interoperability without the need to install additional packages, thereby saving both time and costs by offloading heavy computing tasks (such as call generation) from the application.

### XCM-Router (SpellRouter☄️)
[Router link](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-tools/tree/main/packages/xcm-router) |  
The XCM Router enables seamless XCM exchanges. It allows users to send one token type and receive a different one of their choice on the destination chain, all within a single call and three signatures. This streamlined process enhances the user experience by minimizing the possibility of errors. Currently, the Router integrates with the eight largest Parachain DEXes and is designed for easy expansion as the number of DEXes with public SDKs grows. With 524 asset pools available, the XCM Router is the largest liquidity bridging tool in the ecosystem.

### XCM-Analyser 🔎
[Analyser link](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-tools/tree/main/packages/xcm-analyser) |  
A tool designed to convert XCM multilocations into a human-readable format.

### XCM-Visualizator 🖼️
[Visualizator link](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-tools/tree/main/apps/visualizator-fe) |  
A visualization tool for exploring XCM within the Polkadot ecosystem. It allows users to browse history, explore selected Parachains, filter accounts most engaged in XCM, and more, all within an exciting 3D universe-like visualization.

### XCM-Playground 🛝
[Playground link](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-tools/tree/main/apps/playground) |  
A sandbox environment that allows users to test all ParaSpell applications and packages, including the XCM SDK, XCM API, XCM Router, and XCM Analyser.
