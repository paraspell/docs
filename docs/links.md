[API link](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-tools/tree/main/apps/xcm-api) |
API serves as `XCM`, `HRMP` and `Asset pallet` enhancement to ease developers' life. It integrates XCM-SDK and allows dApp developers to integrate XCM interoperability without the need to install any packages.

All within one call and three signatures. This seamless operation allows for a better user experience limiting possiblities of user error.
