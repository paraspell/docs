# Migration Guide — v10 ➡ v11

This guide covers all **breaking changes** and **new features** introduced in version **v11** of the ParaSpell XCM Tools.  
These changes affect **XCM SDK**, **XCM API**, **XCM Router**, and **XCM Analyser**.

---

## 1. Removal of the `multi` Prefix

In **v11**, all functions and types previously using the `multi` prefix have been **renamed** to remove that prefix.  
For example:

```diff
- multilocation()
+ location()

- getAssetMultilocation()
+ getAssetLocation()
```

This was done, because multi prefix is no longer used within Polkadot.

✅ **Action Required:**  
Update all your function calls, type imports, and references to remove the `multi` prefix.

---

## 2. `NODE` ➡ `CHAIN` Renaming

The term **NODE** is now replaced by **CHAIN** across **types** and **functions**.

Example changes:

```diff
- TNode
+ TChain

- getTNode()
+ getTChain()
```

Term node is not as informative to new developers as term chain.

✅ **Action Required:**  
Search your code for any `NODE` references and replace them with `CHAIN`.

---

## 3. New Chain Division Types

New **chain division types** are introduced for more granular chain handling.  
See documentation: [Import Chains as Constant](https://paraspell.github.io/docs/sdk/AssetPallet.html#import-chains-as-constants)

Example usage:

```ts
// Export all Parachains
console.log(PARACHAINS)

// Export all Relay chains
console.log(RELAYCHAINS)

// Export all Substrate chains (Parachains + Relays)
console.log(SUBSTRATE_CHAINS)

// Export chains outside Polkadot ecosystem (Ethereum)
console.log(EXTERNAL_CHAINS)

// Export all chains implemented in ParaSpell
console.log(CHAINS)
```

Instead of previous

```ts
// Export all Parachains
console.log(CHAINS_WITH_RELAYS)
```

Previous type division was a little messy, new type division counts with chains outside Polkadot ecosystem such as Ethereum as well.

✅ **Action Required:**  
Update your imports if you plan to use these new chain types for improved type safety and consistency.

---

## 4. Decimal Abstraction Setting (`abstractDecimals`)

A new **decimal abstraction** setting has been added to the builder configuration.

### Default Behavior
- **v11 default:** `abstractDecimals: false`
- **Future versions:** Will default to `true`

### Purpose
When enabled in Builder config as {`abstractDecimals: true`}, the SDK automatically abstracts decimals for you.  
For example sending 1 DOT from Relay chain to Asset Hub:

```ts
const builder = await Builder({
    abstractDecimals: true // Abstracts decimals from amount - so 1 in amount for DOT equals 10_000_000_000 
    })
      .from('Polkadot')
      .to('AssetHubPolkadot')
      .currency({symbol: 'DOT', amount: 1}) 
      .address(address)

const tx = await builder.build()

// Make sure to disconnect API after it is no longer used (eg. after transaction)
await builder.disconnect()
```

Instead of default {`abstractDecimals: false`}:

```ts
const builder = await Builder()
      .from('Polkadot')
      .to('AssetHubPolkadot')
      .currency({symbol: 'DOT', amount: 10000000000}) 
      .address(address)

const tx = await builder.build()

// Make sure to disconnect API after it is no longer used (eg. after transaction)
await builder.disconnect()
```

**NOTE:**

We advise everyone who do not wish to use `abstractDecimals` setting to manually set it as `false` to prevent issues when bumping to new versions in the future.

### Special Case: `bigint`
If you pass a `bigint` as the `amount` and **decimal abstraction** is enabled,  
the SDK will **automatically disable** abstraction for that call because `bigint` does not support floating-point numbers.

```ts
//Decimal abstraction will be ignored
const builder = await Builder()
      .from('Polkadot')
      .to('AssetHubPolkadot')
      .currency({symbol: 'DOT', amount: 10000000000n}) 
      .address(address)

const tx = await builder.build()

// Make sure to disconnect API after it is no longer used (eg. after transaction)
await builder.disconnect()
```

✅ **Action Required:**
- If you want **automatic decimal handling**, set `abstractDecimals: true` in your `Builder` configuration.
- Be mindful of the future default change to `true` — review your amount values to ensure they behave as expected.
- Make sure to use String or Number when entering value as Bigint will require decimal inputs.
---

## 5. Multiasset type is now an array:
Previously we used `multiasset` selector for multiple assets in one call with the removal of `multi` prefix we decided to completely replace selector by an array.

Previously:
```ts
.currency(Multiasset: {currencySelection /*for example symbol: symbol or id: id, or location: location*/, amount: amount}, {currencySelection}, ..
)
```

Now:
```ts
.currency([{currencySelection /*for example symbol: symbol or id: id, or location: location*/, amount: amount}, {currencySelection}, ..]
)
```

✅ **Action Required:**
- Replace Multiasset: with an array.
---

## 6. findAsset is now findAssetInfo
The function `findAsset` is not mentioned in docs because it is mainly used internally, but this function allows you to see the support of an asset for a specific chain. It was renamed to `findAssetInfo`. Returns null if not found.

## 7. findAssetOrThrow is now findAssetInfoOrThrow
The function `findAssetOrThrow` is not mentioned in docs because it is mainly used internally, but this function allows you to see the support of an asset for a specific chain. It was renamed to `findAssetInfoOrThrow`. Returns error if not found.

## 8. convertSs58 now uses types for ecosystem param: TRelaychain | TExternalChain
The function previously took ecosystem names in lower case as string 'polkadot', 'kusama', and so on, it has now migrated into using new TRelaychain | TExternalChain chain types to improve the experience. Explore more about the types [here](https://paraspell.github.io/docs/sdk/AssetPallet.html#import-chains-as-types).

## Recommended Migration Steps

1. **Search & Replace**
   - Remove `multi` prefix from all functions and types.
   - Replace `NODE` with `CHAIN` in constants and functions.
   
2. **Adopt Chain Constants**
   - Use the new chain division constants for cleaner imports.
   
3. **Review Decimal Handling**
   - Decide whether to enable `abstractDecimals` now or wait for it to become default in future versions.
   
4. **Test BigInt Scenarios**
   - Ensure `bigint` amounts work as expected without unwanted decimal abstraction.

5. **Replace multiasset currency selectors with array**
   - Make sure to replace multiasset currency selector directly with an array.

6. **Rename findAsset into findAssetInfo**
   - Make sure to rename findAsset function into findAssetInfo
  
7. **Rename findAssetOrThrow into findAssetInfoOrThrow**
   - Make sure to rename findAssetOrThrow function into findAssetInfoOrThrow
  
8. **Replace ecosystem parameter from string to new type TRelaychain | TExternalChain in convertSs58**
   - Make sure to replace old ecosystem parameter accepting string with TRelaychain | TExternalChain param.

This migration ensures compatibility with **v11** and prepares your codebase for future defaults in decimal handling.
