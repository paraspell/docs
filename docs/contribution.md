# 🛠️ Contributing to `xcm-tools`

Thank you for your interest in contributing to `xcm-tools`!  
We run an open Bug Bounty Program that rewards contributors for reporting and fixing bugs in the project.

## 📋 Bug Bounty Overview

You can contribute in two ways:

1. **Report bugs** – Earn rewards based on bug severity.
2. **Fix bugs** – Earn additional rewards based on fix complexity.

## 🔍 Bug Reporting

To report a bug:

1. Open an [issue in the repository](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-tools/issues) and select `Bug bounty report`
2. Fill in all required sections.
3. Submit the issue — maintainers will review and assign a severity level.

### 💰 Rewards for Reporting Bugs

| Severity Level | Description                                                                 | Reward |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| 🟢 Low         | Minor UI issues, typos, or cosmetic bugs                                    | $10    |
| 🟠 Medium      | Bugs affecting user features or causing functional issues                   | $20    |
| 🔴 High        | Crashes, data loss, security vulnerabilities, or major broken functionality | $30    |

> Maintainers determine severity based on impact. Contributors may be contacted for clarification.

## 🛠️ Fixing Bugs

You can contribute fixes to open bug bounty issues.

### 🔒 Reserving an Issue

Before working on a fix:

- Comment on the issue with:  
  > `I would like to reserve this issue.`  
- The issue will be assigned and reserved to you for **48 hours**.
- If no PR is opened within 48 hours, the reservation expires.

### 🔁 Contributing to Your Own Report

If you reported a bug and want to fix it:

- You still need to **reserve the issue**.
- Submit your PR as outlined below.

## 📦 Submitting a Fix

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch.
2. Make your changes and commit with a clear message.
3. Open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-tools/pulls) referencing the issue.
4. **Tag `@michaeldev5`** in the PR description to request a review.

### 💵 Rewards for Fixes

| Complexity | Description                                                                                         | Reward Range |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| 🟢 Low     | Small fix (e.g., 1-2 lines), config changes                                | $10–$20      |
| 🟠 Medium  | Logic changes, multi-file fixes, test additions                                                      | $30–$60      |
| 🔴 High    | Complex refactors, deep bug fixes, architectural or security-critical changes with tests and docs   | $70–$100     |

> The reward is based on code complexity and quality, as determined by maintainers.

## 👥 Collaborating on Existing Issues

If someone has already reported an issue or opened a PR and you want to contribute:
