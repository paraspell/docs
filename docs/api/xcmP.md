# Use XCM SDK🪄 within XCM API
The following guide guides you through the XCM SDK functionality implemented in XCM API.
## Send XCM
This functionality allows you to send XCM messages across the Paraverse.

### Package-less implementation of XCM API XCM features into your application

```ts
//Chain WS API instance that will send generated XCM Call
const provider = getWsProvider('YourChainWSPort') // Specify "YourChainWSPort" with WS Port of sender chain 
const client = createClient(withPolkadotSdkCompat(provider))

const response = await fetch(
    "http://localhost:3001/v4/x-transfer”,
{
	method: ‘POST’,
           	body: JSON.stringify({
                  "from": "origin",
                  "to": "destination",
                  "address": "address",
                  "currency": {currencySpec, amount: amount},
             })
});

const hash = await response.json();

//Received response is parsed to the call
const callData = Binary.fromHex(hash)

// Also possibility to use .getTypedApi()
const tx = await client.getUnsafeApi().txFromCallData(callData)

//Call is then signed and can be subscribed to extrinsics
tx.signAndSubmit(signer)
  .then(() => "Transaction completed")
  .catch((err) => {
    console.log(err)
  })

```

## Localhost testing setup

API offers enhanced localhost support. You can pass an object called options containing overrides for all WS endpoints (Including hops) used in the test transfer. This allows for advanced localhost testing such as localhost dry-run or xcm-fee queries.

**Endpoint**: `Any that can leverage this feature` (From transfers, dry-run to xcm-fee queries)

  <details>
  <summary><b>Parameters</b></summary>

  - Inherited from concrete endpoint

  <summary><b>Notes</b> </summary>

  
```
- The xcm-api accepts an options object in the request body for endpoints like /x-transfer, accepting the same parameters as SDK.

- apiOverrides property is a map where keys are chain names (e.g., Hydration, BridgeHubPolkadot) and values are the corresponding WS endpoint URL / array of WS URLs or an API client instance.

- Development mode parameter: When development flag is set to true, the SDK will throw a MissingChainApiError if an operation involves a chain for which an override has not been provided in apiOverrides. This ensures that in a testing environment, the SDK does not fall back to production endpoints.

  This query will calculate whether user has will have enough to cover existential deposit on XCM arrival using following pseudo formulae: 

  **(if(Balance) || if(TransferedAmount - ED - Destination Fee > 0)) return true else false** 

  **Beware**: If DryRun fails function automatically switches to PaymentInfo for XCM Fees (Less accurate), so this function should only serve for informative purposes (Always run DryRun if chains support it to ensure the message will actually go through). **If function switches to PaymentInfo and transfered currency is different than native currency on destination chain the function throws error as PaymentInfo only returns fees in native asset of the chain.**

## XCM Fee (Origin & Dest.)

### More accurate query using DryRun
The following endpoint allows is designed to retrieve you XCM fee at any cost, but fallbacking to Payment info if DryRun query fails or is not supported by either origin or destination. This endpoint requires user to have token balance (Token that they are sending and origin native asset to pay for execution fees on origin)

**Endpoint**: `POST /v4/xcm-fee`

  <details>
  <summary><b>Parameters</b> </summary>

  - `from` (Inside JSON body): (required): Represents the Parachain from which the assets will be transferred.
  - `to` (Inside JSON body): (required): Represents the Parachain to which the assets will be transferred.
  - `currency` (Inside JSON body): (required): Represents the asset being sent. It should be a string value.
  - `address` (Inside JSON body): (required): Specifies the address of the recipient.
  - `senderAddress` (Inside JSON body): (required): Specifies the address of the XCM sender.

  <details>
  <summary><b>Notes</b> </summary>

  When Payment info is performed, it retrieves fees for destination in destination's native currency, however, they are paid in currency that is being sent. To solve this, you have to convert token(native) to token(transferred) based on price. DryRun returns fees in currency that is being transferred, so no additional calculations necessary in that case.

  **NOTE** If you wish to transfer from Parachain that uses long IDs for example Moonbeam you have to add character 'n' the end of currencyID. Eg: `currency: "42259045809535163221576417993425387648n"` will mean you wish to transfer xcDOT.
